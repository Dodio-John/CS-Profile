# CS-Profile
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The driver pass project was a system that aimed to help student drivers pass their driving exams the first time. DriverPass was web-based and offered multiple different driving packages to the students. The client was the existing system needing a web based application, the system needed to be cloud based and the owner needed access to the system from anywhere.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I captured the functions of multiple driving packages well for the client. I also showcased what would need to be done for all different types of reservations within the system. Users would get a profile and be able to make certain changes while the admin would have access over the system as a whole, I showcased this well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could chose one part of these documents I would revise is the UML Diagrams that I made. I captured all the required functions and they were proper in their form but they lacked color or distinct markings that make them special. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users needs by going off the interview with the DriverPass team. It is important to impliment these needs into the design because the user will be a high traffic user in the system. The user must be considered because the better the user experience is for our clients the more revenue we will bring in. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
You approach designing software with UML Diagrams. These diagraming tools lay out a foundation of what you will need to code, for example the UML Class diagram will show us some of the classes within the system, what attributes and functions those classes will need, as well as how they interact with one another. In the future I will make more UML Diagrams to design a system.
