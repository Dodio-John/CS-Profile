Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The gaming room was a client that wanted to take their application, a game, and have it developed to run on multiple platforms. 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  In this documentation I think I wrote a thorough evaluation of my findings well. I outlined the executive summary for the clients and was descriptive in outlining design constraints and the model. I think this evaluation would lead our client to make good choices in the design of the application. 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I think outining all the design requirements was very helpful in working through this design document. I also appreciated the UML Diagram to walk through the code, something else I found helpful was analyzing the system requirements and design constraints you may face was beneficial as well.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I had to revise one part of this document I would improve upon my analysis of the different platforms. I think I could have been more clear when comparing linux mac and windows for the client. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  When designing something for a client you must consider the users needs. These needs can effect what type of operating platform you choose, such as cloud based or traditional. I used this document to show any challenges that would be faced specific to the users needs and requirements.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approached the software design document very line by line. I took into account what the client had been asking for throughout the development and used my document to outline those needs.
